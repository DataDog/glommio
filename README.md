## What is Glommio?

Glommio (pronounced glo-mee-jow or |glomjÉ™ÊŠ|) is a Cooperative Thread-per-Core crate for Rust & Linux based
on `io_uring`. Like other rust asynchronous crates, it allows one to write asynchronous code that takes advantage of
rust `async`/`await`, but unlike its counterparts, it doesn't use helper threads anywhere.

Using Glommio is not hard if you are familiar with rust async. All you have to do is:

```rust
use glommio::prelude::*;

LocalExecutorBuilder::default().spawn(|| async move {
    /// your async code here
})
.expect("failed to spawn local executor")
.join();
```

Please note Glommio requires at least 512 KiB of locked memory for `io_uring` to work. You can increase the `memlock`
resource limit (rlimit) as follows:

```sh
$ vi /etc/security/limits.conf
*    hard    memlock        512
*    soft    memlock        512
```

To make the new limits effective, you need to log in to the machine again. You can verify that the limits are updated by
running the following:

```sh
$ ulimit -l
512
```

Glommio also requires a kernel with a recent enough `io_uring` support, at least current enough to run discovery probes.
The minimum version at this time is 5.8.
