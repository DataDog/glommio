//! Idiomatic Rust bindings to liburing.
//!
//! This gives users an idiomatic Rust interface for interacting with the Linux
//! kernel's `io_uring` interface for async IO. Despite being idiomatic Rust,
//! this interface is still very low level and some fundamental operations
//! remain unsafe.
//!
//! The core entry point to the API is the `IoUring` type, which manages an
//! `io_uring` object for interfacing with the kernel. Using this, users can
//! submit IO events and wait for their completion.
//!
//! It is also possible to "split" an `IoUring` instance into its constituent
//! components - a `SubmissionQueue`, a `CompletionQueue`, and a `Registrar` -
//! in order to operate on them separately without synchronization.
//!
//! # Submitting events
//!
//! You can prepare new IO events using the `SQE` type. Once an event has been
//! prepared, the next call to submit will submit that event. Eventually, those
//! events will complete, and that a `CQE` will appear on the completion queue
//! indicating that the event is complete.
//!
//! Preparing IO events is inherently unsafe, as you must guarantee that the
//! buffers and file descriptors used for that IO are alive long enough for the
//! kernel to perform the IO operation with them.
//!
//! # Timeouts
//!
//! Some APIs allow you to time out a call into the kernel. It's important to
//! note how this works with io_uring.
//!
//! A timeout is submitted as an additional IO event which completes after the
//! specified time. Therefore when you create a timeout, all that happens is
//! that a completion event will appear after that specified time. This also
//! means that when processing completion events, you need to be prepared for
//! the possibility that the completion represents a timeout and not a normal IO
//! event (`CQE` has a method to check for this).
