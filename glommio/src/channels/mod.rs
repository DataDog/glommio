//! glommio::channels is a module that provides glommio channel-like
//! abstractions.
mod spsc_queue;

/// Allow data to be transmitted across two tasks in the same shard.
///
/// Asynchronous code is rarely useful if it is serialized. In practice,
/// you will want to spawn asynchronous tasks or in the case of Glommio which
/// support multi-queued execution have a dedicated [`TaskQueue`] for each group
/// of tasks with their own priority.
///
/// The `local_channel` is an abstraction similar to the [`channel`] that can be
/// used for this purpose
///
/// The communication between sender and receiver is broken when one of them
/// goes out of scope. They however behave differently:
///
/// * The [`LocalReceiver`] never sees an error, as it provides a stream
///   interface compatible with [`StreamExt`]. When the sender is no longer
///   available the receiver's call to [`next`] will return [`None`].
/// * The [`LocalSender`] will return a
///   [`GlommioError::Closed(..)`](crate::GlommioError::Closed) if it tries to
///   [`send`] into a channel that no longer has a receiver.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use futures_lite::stream::StreamExt;
/// use glommio::{channels::local_channel, Latency, Local, LocalExecutor, Shares};
///
/// let ex = LocalExecutor::default();
/// ex.run(async move {
///     let task_queue =
///         Local::create_task_queue(Shares::default(), Latency::NotImportant, "example");

///     let (sender, mut receiver) = local_channel::new_unbounded();

pub mod local_channel;

/// Allow data to be transmitted across two tasks in the different executors.
///
/// Most useful thread-per-core applications will heavily process data locally
/// to their executor, but at times inter-executor communication is unavoidable
/// (if you never communicate inter-executors, you may consider just using
/// independent processes!)
///
/// Whenever you need to send data across two executors you can use the
/// `shared_channel`. This channel is a fully lockless
/// single-producer-single-consumer channel, unlike the standard
/// library [`channel`], which is multi-producer and need locks for
/// synchronization. That means that to wire N executors to each other you will
/// have to create O(N^2) channels.
///
/// The channels are also not bidirectional, so for full bidirectional
/// communication you will need pairs of channels.
///
/// True to the spirit of our library the `shared_channel` is not created or
/// wired automatically among executors. You can have executors that work as
/// sinks and never respond back, other executors that are not really connected
/// to anybody, cliques of executors, you name it.
///
/// However, note that connecting a channel will involve a blocking operation as
/// we need to synchronize and exchange information between peers. That can
/// block the executor, although in practice that will only happen if it races
/// with the creation of a new executor. Because of that, The best performance
/// pattern when using shared channels is to create both the executors and
/// channels early, connect the channels as soon as they start, and keep them
/// alive.
///
/// Data that goes into the channels need to be [`Send`], as well as the
/// channels themselves (otherwise you would not be able to really pass them
/// along to the actual executors). But to prevent accidental use from multiple
/// producers, the channel endpoints have to be `connected` before
/// using: Connecting consumes the endpoint, transforming a [`SharedSender`]
/// into a [`ConnectedSender`] and a [`SharedReceiver`] into a
/// [`ConnectedReceiver`] so although you can pass one of the ends of the
/// channel to multiple executors, you can only connect in one of them. The
/// connected channel itself is not [`Send`] nor [`Sync`] so once connected they
/// are stuck in an executor.
///
/// The communication between sender and receiver is broken when one of them
/// goes out of scope. They however behave differently:
///
/// * The [`ConnectedReceiver`] never sees an error, as it is implemented as a
///   stream interface compatible with [`StreamExt`]. When the sender is no
///   longer available the receiver's call to [`next`] will return [`None`].
/// * The [`ConnectedSender`] will return a
///   [`GlommioError::Closed(..)`](crate::GlommioError::Closed) if it tries to
///   [`send`] into a channel that no longer has a receiver.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use glommio::{channels::shared_channel, Local, LocalExecutorBuilder};
///
/// // creates both ends of the channel. This is done outside the executors
/// // and we will not pass the sender to ex1 and the receiver to ex2
/// let (sender, receiver) = shared_channel::new_bounded(1);
///
/// let ex1 = LocalExecutorBuilder::new()
///     .spawn(move || async move {
///         // Before using we have to connect. Connecting this endpoint
///         // binds it this executor as the connected endpoint is not Send.
///         let sender = sender.connect().await;
///         // Channel has room for 1 element so this will always succeed
///         sender.try_send(100).unwrap();
///     })
///     .unwrap();
///
/// let ex2 = LocalExecutorBuilder::new()
///     .spawn(move || async move {
///         // much like the sender, the receiver also needs to be connected
///         let receiver = receiver.connect().await;
///         let x = receiver.recv().await.unwrap();
///         assert_eq!(x, 100);

pub mod shared_channel;

/// A channel mesh consists of a group of participating executors (peers) and
/// the channels between selected pairs of them. Two kinds of meshes are
/// supported depending on the peer-pair selection criteria: full mesh and
/// partial mesh.
///
/// With full mesh, every pair of distinct peers are selected, so messages can
/// be sent to every other peer. Full mesh is useful for building kinds of
/// sharding. With partial mesh, peers are assigned a role of either producer or
/// consumer when they join the mesh, and channels are created from producers to
/// consumers.
///
/// Within a mesh, peers are identified by unique peer ids, which are used to
/// specify the source/destination which messages are sent to/received from.
/// Peer ids are determined when the last peer joins the mesh by the indexes to
/// the list of all peers sorted by their executor ids. In this way, multiple
/// meshes can be built over the same set of peers, and the peer ids are
/// guaranteed to be identical across meshes for each peer. This invariance
/// makes it possible to cooperate with multiple meshes.
