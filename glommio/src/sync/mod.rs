//! Set of synchronization primitives.
//!
//! This create provides set of synchronization primitives which are optimized
//! to be used inside of fibers which are driven by single-thread bounded
//! executor.
//!
//! Following primitives are provided.
//!
//! 1. Semaphore - A counting semaphore. Semaphore maintains a set of permits.
//! Each call to ['acquire_permit'] suspends fiber if necessary until a permit
//! is available, and then takes it.
//! Each call to ['signal'] adds a permit, potentially releasing a suspended
//! acquirer. There is also ['try_acquire'] method which fails if semaphore
//! lacks of permits requested without suspending the fiber.
//!
//! 2. RwLock - Implementation of read-write lock optimized for single-thread
//! bounded executor. All methods of RwLock have the same meaning as the methods
//! of [`std::sync::RwLock`]. With exception that RwLock can not be poisoned but
//! can be closed.
