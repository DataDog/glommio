/// with a particular task. Running consumes the [`Task`] reference and polls
/// its internal future. If the future is still pending after getting polled,
/// the [`Task`] reference simply won't exist until a [`Waker`] notifies the
/// task. If the future completes, its result becomes available to the
/// [`JoinHandle`].
///
/// When a task is woken up, its [`Task`] reference is recreated and passed to
/// the schedule function. In most executors, scheduling simply pushes the
/// [`Task`] reference into a queue of runnable tasks.
///
/// If the [`Task`] reference is dropped without getting run, the task is
/// automatically canceled. When canceled, the task won't be scheduled again
/// even if a [`Waker`] wakes it. It is possible for the [`JoinHandle`] to
/// cancel while the [`Task`] reference exists, in which case an attempt
/// to run the task won't do anything.
