//! `glommio::io` provides data structures targeted towards File I/O.
//!
//! File I/O in Glommio comes in two kinds: Buffered and Direct I/O.
//!
//! Ideally an application would pick one of them according to its needs and not mix both.
//! However if you do want to mix both, it is recommended that you do not do so in the same
//! device: Kernel settings like I/O schedulers and merge settings that are beneficial to one
//! of them can be detrimental to the others.
//!
//! If you absolutely must use both in the same device, avoid issuing both Direct and Buffered
//! I/O in the same file: at this point you are just trying to drive Linux crazy.
//!
//! Buffered I/O
//! ============
//!
//! Buffered I/O will use the operating system page cache. It is ideal for simpler applications
//! that don't want to deal with caching policies and have I/O performance as a maybe important,
//! but definitely not crucial part of their performance story.
//!
//! Disadvantages of Buffered I/O:
//!  * Hard to know when resources are really used, which make controlled processes almost
//!    impossible (the time of write to device is detached from the file write time)
//!  * More copies than necessary, as the data has to be copied from the device to the page
//!    cache, from the page cache to the internal file buffers, and in abstract linear
//!    implementations like [`AsyncWriteExt`] and [`AsyncReadExt`] from user-provided buffers
//!    to the file internal buffers.
//!  * Advanced features for io_uring like Non-interrupt mode, registered files, registered
//!    buffers, will not work with Buffered I/O
//!  * Read amplification for small random reads, as the OS is bounded by the page size
//!    (usually 4kB), even though modern NVMe devices are perfectly capable of issuing 512-byte
//!    I/O.
//!
//! The main structure to deal with Buffered I/O is the [`BufferedFile`] struct. It is targeted at
//! random I/O. Reads from and writes to it expect a position.
//!
//! Direct I/O
//! ==========
//!
//! Direct I/O will not use the Operating System page cache and will always touch the device
//! directly. That will always work very well for stream-based workloads (scanning a file much
//! larger than memory, writing a buffer that will not be read from in the near future, etc)
//! but will require a user-provided cache for good random performance.
//!
//! There are advantages to using a user-provided cache: Files usually contain serialized objects
//! and every read have to deserialize them. A user-provided cache can cache the parsed objects,
//! among others. Still, not all applications can or want to deal with that complexity.
//!
//! Disadvantages of Direct I/O:
//! * I/O needs to be aligned. Both the buffers and the file positions need specific alignments.
//!   The [`DmaBuffer`] should hide most of that complexity, but you may still end up with heavy
//!   read amplification if you are not careful.
//! * Without a user-provided cache, random performance can be bad.
//!
//! There are two main structs that deal with File Direct I/O:
//!
//! [`DmaFile`] is targeted at random Direct I/O. Reads from and writes to it
//! expect a position.
//!
//! [`DmaStreamWriter`] and [`DmaStreamReader`] perform sequential I/O and their
//! interface is a lot closer to other mainstream rust interfaces in `std::fs`.
//!
//! However, despite being sequential, I/O for the two Stream structs are parallel:
//! [`DmaStreamWriter`] exposes a setting for write-behind, meaning that it will keep
//! accepting writes to its internal buffers even with older writes are still in-flight.
//! In turn, [`DmaStreamReader`] exposes a setting for read-ahead meaning it will initiate
//! I/O for positions you will read into the future sooner.
